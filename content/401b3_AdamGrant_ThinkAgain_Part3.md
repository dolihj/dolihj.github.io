# Community-Rethinking

> Requiring proof is an enemy of progress 

## Does my company provide psychological safety? 
 The range is now extended from individuals and interpersonnel rethinking to creating a learning community. I started my 20s career as a programmer and system engineer. In company orientation, they shared the firm's vision and missions. They emphasized that one of their core value is being innovative and encouraged employees to be awake and creative. Ironically, their innovation program was not innovative at all. I expected a lot of questions and new ideas during the week program but there was not much space for arguments or debates. Trainers had absolute powers and trainees should follow their instructions. I still wonder why it was named an innovation program after completing that course. After moving jobs a couple more times, I saw what makes organizations different. Are they open to their employee's thoughts or questions? Are they willing to change their views? Do they provide a comfortable environment for their colleagues to share different opinions?

## Psychological Safety vs Performance Culture

Many people might be told of NASA's space launching failure and the reason was a small part O-ring sealing in low temperature. Yes, we've learned smart people can make mistakes as well - even if they are rocket scientists! The book points out that performance culture could prevent any objections or ignore any red flags from engineers. I am pretty sure any worker had similar issues with their managers or coworkers. A lot of supervisors worry that an unexpected red sign would undermine their projects and instead of investigating issues, they rather ignore the sign. If the community welcomes any questions and they are open to restudy with different views, it provides psychological safety.


## How to work with constructive feedback and join the challenge network
 
Community rethinking encourages you to join the challenge network which has different opinions and background members. And it shows a circular flow diagram of a person who is obsessed with the flat earth myth. One idea hits their minds, the next step would be searching and joining the group having similar thoughts. It ensured their insistence and they easily fall into the overconfidence cycle. One day, NPR broadcasted an interview with the capital riots after they were convicted. They said they believe they were doing the right thing patriotically and they tried to save the country. I was shocked a group of homogeneous thinkers could be dangerous. And we see that very similar social phenomenon in group communities almost everywhere. Healthy nature has a variety of organs. A healthy society should embrace diversity. From there, we can start constructive feedback and community should require psychological safety without worrying of being different.
