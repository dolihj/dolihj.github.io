# MyThought

```note
1. start with fleeting note 
 - from Doc, book, webpage 
 - fleeting idea 
 - ready to remove/discard paper, note  	 
2. Literature : Rewrite auther's thought  
3. Permanent : Write what you think  
4. Link your permanent,literature notes 
5. Benefit of fleeting note : feel less guilty about making all trivial note - cuz I know I will organize and review them!
