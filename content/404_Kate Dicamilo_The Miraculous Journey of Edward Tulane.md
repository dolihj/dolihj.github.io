한결이 등쌀에 읽은 ...  
Not my cup of tea. Hann kept asking me whether the story was satisfying but I only cared (and worried) about the little boy Bryce. 
After losing his little sister and beaten by his violent father, he tried to survive on his own in the street. 
As  such a big-hearted boy, he had given up Tulane to amend him and hadn't have a chance to hug him the last time. 

As a mom, I almost cried for him and his life after that. 
After the story ends, I only wished Bryce couldn't be hurt and meet a kind people who would raise him with love and care.
