# Opening other people's minds

## Start your debate
 
   It was pretty convincing that I could train myself to rethink. The book also moves to an interpersonal rethinking by suggesting several ways to debate. Yes, debate. In other forms of war. Your logic is your weapon. And it is not about how to negotiate. _If you are interested in negotiation skills, here is the bible: You can negotiate anything written by Herb Cohen._ Do you think you can convince white supremacists to stop their hatred? Or can you start a conversation with parents who are opposed to vaccination? Of course, it won't be easy but it is not an impossible task the author says.


## Question, Listen and Respect

 Then, how to encourage them to rethink? The first step is listening to your partner (not lecturing). The book proves that influential listening does work with two examples. One story is about Daryl Davis, the black pianist who opened KKK members' minds and persuaded them to leave the KKK. And another case is Arnaud the vaccine whisperer and Marie, an anti-vaxxer mom. White supremacists and anti-vaxxers are not someone you can easily convince to change their views but Daryl and Arnaud proved it is possible. They both waited to build a trusting relationship and respected their decisions by listening sincerely. 
  And also they always asked for their permission before sharing opinions. I think this is important to ask about their allowance before sharing my information or opinion. In the final step, Daryl and Arnuad affirmed their freedom to make up their minds. The key is that your partners should feel comfortable while discussing thoughts and the decision should be solely theirs without any pressure. 

That is the difference between debate and negotiation 

> A good debate is not a war ... It's more like a dnace. If you try too hard to lead, your partner will resist. If you can adjust your move to hers and get her to do the same, you are more likely to end up in the rythm. 


## Respect, Respect and Respect

 Interpersonal rethinking is not for winning the debates. Although its ultimate goal might be the same- convincing your partner it focuses on your partner to be the subject of the change. If you try to change their minds with data, a handful of facts and research results, that can make you a logic bully. You might win the battle but you might fail to make him or her rethink and hurt the relationship in the worst case. It reminds my past failures in convincing my family or friends as being a logic-bully. What is the purpose of debating or arguments, if I cannot cause any changes to them even after I won debates with the best data and logic? yes. It is pointless. What should I have then? Back into individual rethinking.How about stepping back and asking a question myself - my insistence is right? 

And always keep that in mind, they are the owners of their decisions. 

> The power of listening does not lie just in giving people the space to reflect on their views. It's a disply of respect and an expressioin of care. 


# Respect the other's decision
 Sometimes, we easily burn our bridges as a result of disagreements. Or we hesitate to build any relationship with anyone who has a different background or even taste.  _When I added a Hawaiian pizza order to our team pizza party, I still remember my coworker's joke. "I don't understand this. Is that for punishment?"_   I cannot force him to try it. I might suggest.  I could not force them to change their thinking in debates also.  I need to ask a question first to understand them. Listening is a prerequired step to start a discussion. My evidence or logic is useful only when my debate partner wants to exchange. And again, respect that they are the owner of the decision. You cannot be and you should not be.
