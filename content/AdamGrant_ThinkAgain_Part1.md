Title : What makes you rethink or prevents you from it? 

#  Why do I read Think Again? 

> "Life is about choices and decisions we make."  

## At the crossroad of the choices
 While reading 'Less traveled', a picture of a big tree map with lots of branches and twigs was kept in my head. And it looks similar to routing path algorithm which decides where to deliver packets from source and destination. Others depict life as a journey or marathon. Whatever the variation is, they all talk about roads and it is not a single track. We always come to the fork of a road. In front of the branch, we have to make a choice of which path we would take. And that decision changes our lives. I wondered how to make a better decision at every moment.  How can I less regret at least? And I hope "Think Again" could help me to be a better decision-maker. 

# Prologue  - Question what you have or what you know.
This book consists of three parts. 
* individual rethinking 
* interpersonal rethinking.
* How to create a community of rethinking

 In the prologue, it starts with a survival story of three smokejumpers from wildland fire- Interestingly, I read the same story in the book Range - written by David Epstein three months ago.  These two books are delivering the same message. Throw out what you have or what you know. Generate different questions to old, existing problems.   

# 1. Individual Rethinking - Being an imposter

##  We all could be wrong. 
 
 How to update my views? The book encourages us to be in the scientist mode rather than preacher, prosecutor or politician. Being a scientist is not wearing a white gown nor explaining math and physics formulas. Scientific thinking would be simplified as having steps of hypothesis, experiment and pivot. And it could be a cycle until you persuade yourself.  As everyone makes mistakes, we all could be wrong.  Mike Lazaridis made the right choice to launch BlackBerry phones in 2009. And in 2014, he failed with the same product by refusing to doubt his products. As generations are changed, his products should be changed.  Mike overlooked how smartphones changed people's behavior. It tells us about Albert Einstein one of the greatest smartest scientists in history, who also failed to be a scientist by denying quantum physics. Did I question enough myself, my knowledge and my way? How can I be in the scientist mode? My answer is "Admit I could be wrong"

## Approach with humility

Once we admit that we could be wrong, the next step might be easier. Find a blind spot with confident humility. It sounds easy but it is not easy.  When my elementary school kid had a good grade in his math class, he announced that he knows math.  He knows fractions but he doesn't know what else is in math. We grown-up does the same thing in a certain stage. When a beginner starts learning in transit from novice to amateur, we became over-confident and were trapped in the mountain stupid. The antidote is humility by being an imposter and having doubts as a scientist. After that, we can try to rethink and relearn. 


## Enjoy being wrong

Another helpful tip of being an imposter is detachment. Detach your past from your present and detach your opinion from your identity. It does not have to be painful as you separate your opinion from your identity. I should question my value no what I believe which could be opinions, beliefs, ideas and ideologies. People easily feel uncomfortable in any disagreement including me. What if we can take the disagreement as a chance of rethinking instead of taking as an attack to our identities? As having any conflict I can step back and question what I insist. And it could be much easier by detaching myself from my opinion. 

# Nothing is forever thus we have to rethink
Life does change no matter whether you like it or not. And the change extends to what you think you've known or you've treated as an immutable fact. The best practice would be for you to be flexible and to rethink.
