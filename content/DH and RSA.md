# How to Use RSA and Diffie-Hellman 

RSA( public key) is good for **security**  but **complicated computation** takes device resources. 
Diffie-Hellman is good for symmetric key exchange but it is vulerable to **man-in-the middle attack**

Thus sharing key encrypted with public key + digital cert would be a solution
