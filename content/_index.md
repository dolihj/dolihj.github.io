# Hi! I am DoliHJ

This page initiated 2023. 02.18 by using [Quartz ](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)+ [GitHub Page ](https://pages.github.com/)
Here is how I built mine -[[100a Obsidian Publish - Quartz and GitHub Page]]

## [[001 network index | 001 Learn Network]]

## [[002_Automation |002 Newtork Automation]]

## [[003 English Training]]

## [[004 Be a Reader |004 Book Reading]]



## Get Started Quartz 

> 📚 Step 1: [Setup your own digital garden using Quartz](notes/setup.md)
Host your second brain and [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) for free. Quartz features

1. Extremely fast natural-language [[notes/search]]
2. Customizable and hackable design based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
3. Automatically generated backlinks, link previews, and local graph
4. Built-in [[notes/CJK + Latex Support (测试) | CJK + Latex Support]] and [[notes/callouts | Admonition-style callouts]]
5. Support for both Markdown Links and Wikilinks

Check out some of the [amazing gardens that community members](notes/showcase.md) have published with Quartz or read about [why I made Quartz](notes/philosophy.md) to begin with.

If you prefer browsing the contents of this site through a list instead of a graph, you see a list of all [setup-related notes](/tags/setup).
