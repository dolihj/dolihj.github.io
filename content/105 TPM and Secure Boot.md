Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a hardware component that provides secure storage of cryptographic keys and other sensitive information, such as passwords and encryption keys. It is used to enhance the security of a computer or device by providing a secure environment for storing and using these keys.

Secure Boot is a security feature that ensures that a device only runs software that is trusted and has not been tampered with. It works by verifying the digital signature of the firmware and operating system before they are allowed to run. Secure Boot uses the TPM to store the keys that are used to verify the signatures.

Together, TPM and Secure Boot provide a secure boot process that ensures that a device only runs trusted firmware and operating system software. This helps to prevent malicious software from running on the device and provides an additional layer of protection against malware and other security threats.
