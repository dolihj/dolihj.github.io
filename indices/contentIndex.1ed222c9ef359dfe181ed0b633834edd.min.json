It is used to enhance the security of a computer or device by providing a secure environment for storing and using these keys.\n\nSecure Boot is a security feature that ensures that a device only runs software that is trusted and has not been tampered with. It works by verifying the digital signature of the firmware and operating system before they are allowed to run. Secure Boot uses the TPM to store the keys that are used to verify the signatures.\n\nTogether, TPM and Secure Boot provide a secure boot process that ensures that a device only runs trusted firmware and operating system software. This helps to prevent malicious software from running on the device and provides an additional layer of protection against malware and other security threats.","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T02:51:01.234285634Z","tags":null},"/002_Automation":{"title":"","content":"Network Automation for Network Engineers \n\n[[002a Ansible group_vars and host_vars precedence]]  How to set up group_vars and children group - my mistake \n[[ansible_timestamp]]\n[[002a1 Using Variable in Value]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T02:51:01.234285634Z","tags":null},"/002a-Ansible-group_vars-and-host_vars-precedence":{"title":"","content":"If you would like to print out Group 'GROUP1' variables each host _vars   variable \n\n- Group Name : GROUP1\n- Host_vars : sitenum  \n```ini\n# Inventory file \n[GROUP1]\nhost_101\nhost_102\nhost_103\n```\n\n```yml \n#host_101.yml \nsitenum: 101\n\n#host_102.yml \nsitenum: 102\n\n#host_103.yml \nsitenum: 103\n\n```\n\n```yml \n\n  - name: Groupmembers variable print out \n    debug: \n      msg:   \n      - \"{{hostvars[item].sitenum}}\" \n    loop: \"{{groups['GROUP1']}}\" \n\n\n    #hostvars[inventory_hostname].keys()\n```\n  ","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T02:51:01.234285634Z","tags":null},"/002a1-Using-Variable-in-Value":{"title":"","content":"[[002a Ansible group_vars and host_vars precedence]]\nHow to use ansible variable with same name and default variable manipulation. \n\n\n_As a network engineer, similar config can be applied to multiple device. their variable structure is the same like interfaces for the same model but its value would vary.

In my college hood, I  still didn't like English and it was only needed for TOEIC score.  A year before graduation, I started an AFKN program. The program trained students to listen and dictate after watching US news. The video script was only 3-5min but we had to repeat the same sentence over and over for an hour. It sounds easy and boring but I started enjoying the class. And after 6months, I started understanding what NBC news anchors saying. Once I could focus on \"sound\" rather than \"Word\", I started imitating how anchors pronounce and intonations. It was my starting point when I took English as a real language. There was no shortcut to learning a new language. You have to keep repeating it. \n \n# Why do I recommend Work Audio Book? \nThe lesson that I got from the AFKN program,was that repeating - listening and speaking was the key. Thus I searched for MP3 player program helping to practice by repeating multiple fragments. And WorkAudioBook has all features that I wanted. \n\n**Features \n1. Automatic phrase selection \n2. Convenient repeat repetition \n3. Pause between Phrase \n\n3rd feature is the most important for me. Since I need to speak what I heard, I need to pause its play and make an output. It is a bit different than shadowing. I can only say what I truly understood. I use WorkAudioBook during driving thus I do not need to control the app at all. \n\n# How to use Work Audio Book? \n* Support systems : **Windows, Android \n* Download : Free for 10min/day in Windows, Android(not sure aobut limitation since I purchased long time aga )\n[http://www.workaudiobook.com/](./img/http://www.workaudiobook.com/)\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.povalyaev.WorkAudioBook](./img/https://play.google.com/store/)\n\n\nIt is an application interface and very straightforward. \n![Work Audio Book](003b2_WABbasic.png)\n\n![Control Panel](003b3_WABcontrol.png)\nImages Source:http://www.workaudiobook.com/workaudiobook/how-to-use(windows).aspx\n\nIn the setting, you can split the file into short phrases. And select how long to pause between phrases. \nIt has lots of buttons but it is easy and simple to use. \n\n\n# Summary \n\n I recommend using it without a script first. When new(unknown) vocabulary is heard,  I can simply guess its meaning or search for similar sounds in google that will correct if misspelled. \n\nThis is not shadowing that sometimes deceives me that I speak correctly.

And it looks similar to routing path algorithm which decides where to deliver packets from source and destination. Others depict life as a journey or marathon. Whatever the variation is, they all talk about roads and it is not a single track. We always come to the fork of a road. In front of the branch, we have to make a choice of which path we would take. And that decision changes our lives. I wondered how to make a better decision at every moment.  How can I less regret at least? And I hope \"Think Again\" could help me to be a better decision-maker. \n\n# Prologue  - Question what you have or what you know.\nThis book consists of three parts. \n* individual rethinking \n* interpersonal rethinking.\n* How to create a community of rethinking\n\n In the prologue, it starts with a survival story of three smokejumpers from wildland fire- Interestingly, I read the same story in the book Range - written by David Epstein three months ago.  These two books are delivering the same message. Throw out what you have or what you know. Generate different questions to old, existing problems.   \n\n# 1. Individual Rethinking - Being an imposter\n\n##  We all could be wrong. \n \n How to update my views? The book encourages us to be in the scientist mode rather than preacher, prosecutor or politician. Being a scientist is not wearing a white gown nor explaining math and physics formulas. Scientific thinking would be simplified as having steps of hypothesis, experiment and pivot. And it could be a cycle until you persuade yourself.  As everyone makes mistakes, we all could be wrong.  Mike Lazaridis made the right choice to launch BlackBerry phones in 2009. And in 2014, he failed with the same product by refusing to doubt his products. As generations are changed, his products should be changed.  Mike overlooked how smartphones changed people's behavior. It tells us about Albert Einstein one of the greatest smartest scientists in history, who also failed to be a scientist by denying quantum physics. Did I question enough myself, my knowledge and my way? How can I be in the scientist mode? My answer is \"Admit I could be wrong\"\n  \n\u003e \"Arrogance leaves us blind to our weakness, confident humility is a corrective lens which enables us to overcom those weaknesses\"\n\n## Approach with humility\n\nOnce we admit that we could be wrong, the next step might be easier. Find a blind spot with confident humility. It sounds easy but it is not easy.  When my elementary school kid had a good grade in his math class, he announced that he knows math.  He knows fractions but he doesn't know what else is in math. We grown-up does the same thing in a certain stage. When a beginner starts learning in transit from novice to amateur, we became over-confident and were trapped in the mountain stupid. The antidote is humility by being an imposter and having doubts as a scientist. After that, we can try to rethink and relearn. \n\n\n## Enjoy being wrong\n\nAnother helpful tip of being an imposter is detachment. Detach your past from your present and detach your opinion from your identity. It does not have to be painful as you separate your opinion from your identity. I should question my value no what I believe which could be opinions, beliefs, ideas and ideologies. People easily feel uncomfortable in any disagreement including me. What if we can take the disagreement as a chance of rethinking instead of taking as an attack to our identities? As having any conflict I can step back and question what I insist. And it could be much easier by detaching myself from my opinion. \n\n# Nothing is forever thus we have to rethink\nLife does change no matter whether you like it or not. And the change extends to what you think you've known or you've treated as an immutable fact. The best practice would be for you to be flexible and to rethink. \n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T02:51:01.242285713Z","tags":null},"/004b2_AdamGrant_ThinkAgain_Part2":{"title":"","content":"# Opening other people's minds\n\n## Start your debate\n \n   It was pretty convincing that I could train myself to rethink. The book also moves to an interpersonal rethinking by suggesting several ways to debate. Yes, debate. In other forms of war. Your logic is your weapon. And it is not about how to negotiate. _If you are interested in negotiation skills, here is the bible: You can negotiate anything written by Herb Cohen._ Do you think you can convince white supremacists to stop their hatred? Or can you start a conversation with parents who are opposed to vaccination? Of course, it won't be easy but it is not an impossible task the author says.\n\n\n## Question, Listen and Respect\n\n Then, how to encourage them to rethink? The first step is listening to your partner (not lecturing). The book proves that influential listening does work with two examples. One story is about Daryl Davis, the black pianist who opened KKK members' minds and persuaded them to leave the KKK. And another case is Arnaud the vaccine whisperer and Marie, an anti-vaxxer mom. White supremacists and anti-vaxxers are not someone you can easily convince to change their views but Daryl and Arnaud proved it is possible. They both waited to build a trusting relationship and respected their decisions by listening sincerely. \n  And also they always asked for their permission before sharing opinions. I think this is important to ask about their allowance before sharing my information or opinion. In the final step, Daryl and Arnuad affirmed their freedom to make up their minds. The key is that your partners should feel comfortable while discussing thoughts and the decision should be solely theirs without any pressure. \n\nThat is the difference between debate and negotiation \n\n\u003e A good debate is not a war ... It's more like a dnace. If you try too hard to lead, your partner will resist. If you can adjust your move to hers and get her to do the same, you are more likely to end up in the rythm. \n\n\n## Respect, Respect and Respect\n\n Interpersonal rethinking is not for winning the debates. Although its ultimate goal might be the same- convincing your partner it focuses on your partner to be the subject of the change. If you try to change their minds with data, a handful of facts and research results, that can make you a logic bully. You might win the battle but you might fail to make him or her rethink and hurt the relationship in the worst case. It reminds my past failures in convincing my family or friends as being a logic-bully. What is the purpose of debating or arguments, if I cannot cause any changes to them even after I won debates with the best data and logic? yes. It is pointless. What should I have then? Back into individual rethinking.How about stepping back and asking a question myself - my insistence is right? \n\nAnd always keep that in mind, they are the owners of their decisions. \n\n\u003e The power of listening does not lie just in giving people the space to reflect on their views. It's a disply of respect and an expressioin of care. \n\n\n# Respect the other's decision\n Sometimes, we easily burn our bridges as a result of disagreements. Or we hesitate to build any relationship with anyone who has a different background or even taste.  _When I added a Hawaiian pizza order to our team pizza party, I still remember my coworker's joke. \"I don't understand this. Is that for punishment?\"_   I cannot force him to try it. I might suggest.  I could not force them to change their thinking in debates also.  I need to ask a question first to understand them. Listening is a prerequired step to start a discussion. My evidence or logic is useful only when my debate partner wants to exchange. And again, respect that they are the owner of the decision. You cannot be and you should not be. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T02:51:01.242285713Z","tags":null},"/004b3_AdamGrant_ThinkAgain_Part3":{"title":"","content":"# Community-Rethinking\n\n\u003e Requiring proof is an enemy of progress \n\n## Does my company provide psychological safety? \n The range is now extended from individuals and interpersonnel rethinking to creating a learning community. I started my 20s career as a programmer and system engineer. In company orientation, they shared the firm's vision and missions. They emphasized that one of their core value is being innovative and encouraged employees to be awake and creative. Ironically, their innovation program was not innovative at all. I expected a lot of questions and new ideas during the week program but there was not much space for arguments or debates. Trainers had absolute powers and trainees should follow their instructions. I still wonder why it was named an innovation program after completing that course. After moving jobs a couple more times, I saw what makes organizations different. Are they open to their employee's thoughts or questions? Are they willing to change their views? Do they provide a comfortable environment for their colleagues to share different opinions?\n\n## Psychological Safety vs Performance Culture\n\nMany people might be told of NASA's space launching failure and the reason was a small part O-ring sealing in low temperature. Yes, we've learned smart people can make mistakes as well - even if they are rocket scientists! The book points out that performance culture could prevent any objections or ignore any red flags from engineers. I am pretty sure any worker had similar issues with their managers or coworkers. A lot of supervisors worry that an unexpected red sign would undermine their projects and instead of investigating issues, they rather ignore the sign. If the community welcomes any questions and they are open to restudy with different views, it provides psychological safety.\n\n\n## How to work with constructive feedback and join the challenge network\n \nCommunity rethinking encourages you to join the challenge network which has different opinions and background members. And it shows a circular flow diagram of a person who is obsessed with the flat earth myth. One idea hits their minds, the next step would be searching and joining the group having similar thoughts. It ensured their insistence and they easily fall into the overconfidence cycle. One day, NPR broadcasted an interview with the capital riots after they were convicted. They said they believe they were doing the right thing patriotically and they tried to save the country. I was shocked a group of homogeneous thinkers could be dangerous. And we see that very similar social phenomenon in group communities almost everywhere. Healthy nature has a variety of organs. A healthy society should embrace diversity. From there, we can start constructive feedback and community should require psychological safety without worrying of being different. \n\n\n# Conclusion \n[TBD]","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T02:51:01.242285713Z","tags":null},"/004b_AdamGrant_ThinkAgain_memo":{"title":"","content":"Title : Think again\nAuthor : Adam Grant \n\nProlog \n![](thinkagain.00prologue.png)\n\n![ta ch1 01](ta.ch1.01.png)\n![](ta.ch1.02.png)\n![](ta.ch2.png)\n![](ta.ch3.png)\n![](Ta.ch05.png)\n![](Ta.ch06.png)  \n![](Ta.ch.07.png) \n\nWarning sign on Overconfident. \nMeh.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1.

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e üîó Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-19T02:51:01.302286302Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
